      <h2>Look. Pigeons.</h2>
      <p>Pondering, wandering, eating, seldom flying. With red, black, or sometimes brown eyes, they march forward in &ldquo;the greatest city of the world&rdquo;, though their sideways gaze never captures what lies straight ahead. Their steps are slow but heavy, sometimes with an unexpected leap, as if every path across the pavement already belongs to them. When I approach, they only wiggle their fat bodies and continue their business, unbothered. The ground belongs to them, not me.</p>
      <p>I am powerless before them. Their unbothered attitude declares it. I try to summon their attention&mdash;striding closer, flapping my arms, squeaking in a low voice. Yet they never turn their heads. I can only watch one side of their heads, catching the shine of one small, watery eye. An eye that reflects the sky, the teaching buildings, but never me. Their indifference is stronger than my performance.</p>
      <p>Glowing are their feathers. Gray melting into violet, green sliding into silver, brown as the earth. Dust is caught in them, crumbs of New York City pressed into every strand. Still they shimmer when the light strikes. Even when they crouch by a trash can, their feathers break into colors, as if the dirt can never smother them. Stay long enough, and they gleam.</p>
      <p>Even crumbs on the ground, they treat as their own. I watch them lower their heads, peck once, twice, then pause or peck another time, determined by where the crumbs fly to. They shake their neck slightly when they swallow, and then lift their head again with dignity, as though each forgotten crust on the ground is a six-course meal offered in their honor. A chip bag, some leftover sandwiches, rotted cabbage, they ultimately gathered around, step by step with wiggling bodies. They never rush, never doubt that the world will feed them again. They live on what is left behind, but they never seem desperate.</p>
      <p>Once, I thought they might scatter at my shadow. But no&mdash;their wings stay folded, their steps steady. It is I who step inside, circling around them. I&rsquo;m the guest and they are kings. A bicycle wheel clatters on the street, several shouts echo through the square, and still they remain. They are never startled, only shifting routes when they wish&mdash;never when told. Pavement is their kingdom, and I pass through.</p>
      <p>Not truly powerless. They cannot know this, cannot imagine the things I carry in my mind, the knowledge of what could undo them in a breath. Their eyes look sideways, never forward. They rule by indifference, and I rule by restraint. Between us, there is a balance&mdash;my false weakness, their false reign. And so they walk ahead, unafraid, while I follow, pretending.</p>

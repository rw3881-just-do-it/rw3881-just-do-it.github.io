It is a personalized blog of myself.
I am the author of all the contents that the blog presents.
If there's something not produced by myself, I will link a reference.
The blog is planned to be content heavy. In thie future, I plan to add more media on it.
I will learn how to do that when I approached to that place.

This blog is created to let me record myself. It should never be judged, translated, or interpreted without my permission AND clarification. You can find my contact in About section.
This blog should be a peaceful place where we can escape the maxium of "living in present" and dive into the deep ocean of memory.

Many Thanks to IB and some of my friends. Without them, I would not have the idea to create a personal blog using Github.

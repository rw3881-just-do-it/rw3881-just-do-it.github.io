      <h2>For Visitors with a Purpose</h2>
      <p>Greetings from Rui. Welcome. I see this website as a personal blog, so you can view most of my works (technical and literal) here. There are four sections in this blog:
      About, Technical, Personal, and Fanfiction. You can find my personal information and my self-description in About section. You can find my technical works with links
      to papers in Technical section. You can find my free-time writings in Personal section. For the Fanfiction section, it is still under preparation, since I wrote
      most of my fanfiction works in Chinese, and I need to translate them into English somehow.</p>

      <h2>For Those who Wander</h2>
      <p>You might not know why you're here. That's fine. Welcome to the bonfire. Find yourself a chair and take a rest. It is through these small resting spots that we could move on, right?</p>

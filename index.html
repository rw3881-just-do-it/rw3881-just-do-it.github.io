      <h2>For Visitors</h2>
      <p>So, you've found this place. I'm sorry that this place is not a bonefire for you. It's a personal bonefire for myself. A rest place. A piece of mind in a passed space and time. But I guess I can never call a bonefire to be mine. So, welcome, sit down, take few deep breathe, leave your mind from the busying reality. When you're ready, feel free to explore this place as you like.</p>

    <div class="post">
      <h2>For Those who Wander</h2>
      <p>You might not know why you're here. That's fine. Welcome to the bonefire. Find yourself a chair and take a rest. It is through these small resting spots that we could move on, right?</p>

      <h2>For Visitors with a Purpose</h2>
      <p>Greetings from Rui. Welcome. Feel free to listen my carefully picked BGM by sliding the volume key at the bottom of the page. <br>
        I see this website as a personal blog, so you can view most of my works (technical and literary) here. There are four sections in this blog: About, Technical, Personal, and Fanfiction. You can find my personal information and self-description in the About section. You can find my technical works, with links to papers, in the Technical section. You can find my free-time writings in the Personal section. As for the Fanfiction section, it is still under preparation, since I wrote most of my fanfiction works in Chinese, and I need to translate them into English somehow.</p>

      <h2>For Those who Wander</h2>
      <p>You might not know why you’re here. That’s fine. Welcome to the bonfire. Find yourself a chair and take a rest. It is through these small resting spots that we can move on. At least that's what I believe.</p>

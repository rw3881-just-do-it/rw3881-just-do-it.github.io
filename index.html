      <h2>For Visitors with a Purpose</h2>
      <p>So, you've found this place. I'm sorry that this place is not a bonfire for you. It's a personal bonfire for myself. A rest place. A piece of mind in a passed space and time. But I guess I can never call a bonfire to be mine. Anyway, welcome, please sit down, take few deep breathe, and leave your mind from your reality. When you're ready, feel free to explore this place as you like.</p>

    <div class="post">
      <h2>For Those who Wander</h2>
      <p>You might not know why you're here. That's fine. Welcome to the bonfire. Find yourself a chair and take a rest. It is through these small resting spots that we could move on, right?</p>

      <h2>Look. Pigeons.</h2>

      <p>Pondering, wandering, eating, seldom flying. With red, black, or sometimes brown eyes, they march forward in “the greatest city of the world”, though their sideways gaze never captures what lies straight ahead. Their steps are slow but heavy, sometimes with an unexpected leap, as if every path across the pavement already belongs to them. When I approach, they only wiggle their fat bodies and continue their business, unbothered. The ground belongs to them, not me.</p>

      <p>I am powerless before them. Their unbothered attitude declares it. I try to summon their attention—striding closer, flapping my arms, squeaking in a low voice. Yet they never turn their heads. I can only watch one side of their heads, catching the shine of one small, watery eye. An eye that reflects the sky, the teaching buildings, but never me. Their indifference is stronger than my performance.</p>

      <p>Glowing are their feathers. Gray melting into violet, green sliding into silver, brown as the earth. Dust is caught in them, crumbs of New York City pressed into every strand. Still they shimmer when the light strikes. Even when they crouch by a trash can, their feathers break into colors, as if the dirt can never smother them. Stay long enough, and they gleam.</p>

      <p>Even crumbs on the ground, they treat as their own. I watch them lower their heads, peck once, twice, then pause or peck another time, determined by where the crumbs fly to. They shake their neck slightly when they swallow, and then lift their head again with dignity, as though each forgotten crust on the ground is a six-course meal offered in their honor. A chip bag, some leftover sandwiches, rotted cabbage, they ultimately gathered around, step by step with wiggling bodies. They never rush, never doubt that the world will feed them again. They live on what is left behind, but they never seem desperate.</p>

      <p>Once, I thought they might scatter at my shadow. But no—their wings stay folded, their steps steady. It is I who step inside, circling around them. I’m the guest and they are kings. A bicycle wheel clatters on the street, several shouts echo through the square, and still they remain. They are never startled, only shifting routes when they wish never when told. Pavement is their kingdom, and I pass through.</p>

      <p>Not truly powerless. They cannot know this, cannot imagine the things I carry in my mind, the knowledge of what could undo them in a breath. Their eyes look sideways, never forward. They rule by indifference, and I rule by restraint. Between us, there is a balance – my false weakness, their false reign. And so they walk ahead, unafraid, while I follow, pretending.</p>

      <p>In Beijing, where I came from, pigeons startled at the faintest shadow of me. A shoe scuff, an unconscious cough, and the flock would erupt into the air, and then gray wings slapping against the sky as though each second on the ground risked death. That nervousness seemed to belong not just to the bird in front of me but to something older, something pressed into them by history. My grandparents once told me their experience during the Cultural Revolution, when sparrows and pigeons were hunted because they fed on grain that was not even enough to feed humans. Whole neighborhoods banged pots and pans to drive birds from the rice fields, a war waged between hunger and hunger. The birds flew until they fell, dead because of hunger and tiredness. Even if these pigeons were born long after that time, I wondered if fear can be inherited in the body and written into their sudden decision of when to fly. To live as a pigeon in Beijing, from my human perspective, is to live ready to leave.</p>

      <p>New York pigeons are the opposite. They do not scatter. They do not flee. They stay, heavy with crumbs, planted in the middle of a sidewalk as if the street belongs to them. They bob with a confidence I did not know pigeons could hold. It is a different city that made them this way: one built on excess, on food left in trash bins, on a thousand hands tossing crusts and fries without thinking. They never lived as prey but as inheritors of waste, and the arrogance of their stillness is somehow similar to the arrogance of the busy New Yorkers who stride past them without looking down. The New York pigeons live in a way of fitting the rhythm of a city that rewards indifference with living rather than simply survival.</p>

      <p>And yet, across Beijing and New York, one truth remains: human never erase them. Frightening only scatters. Killing only delays. The pigeons return to the alleys of my hometown and to the plazas of New York, to the shadow of rice history and to the shadow of skyscrapers.</p>

      <p>John Berger, in “Why Look at Animals?”, writes that animals once stood at the very center of human imagination. Our ancestors once painted them on cave walls, told stories about them, measured our own existence against theirs. But in the modern city, animals are no longer companions or mysteries. They are dimensioned to images in advertisements, to spectacles behind glass, to creatures we look at but no longer live with (Berger, 20). Their presence is both everywhere and nowhere. Animals shaped the way I imagined strength, survival, even the divine. I was told stories of foxes to explain cunning, tigers to explain courage, and Circe’s lions as friends to goddess. But now, I view them through glass, pictures, memes, without ever needing to share a world with them.</p>

      <p>For Berger, the act of looking at animals reveals a distance that cannot be crossed. We want the animal’s gaze to confirm us, to show recognition, but what we meet instead is a look that passes through us. The animal does not answer. Its gaze is not empty, but it belongs to another world, one we cannot enter. That is why, Berger argues, when we look at animals we often end up seeing not them but ourselves: our values, our fears, our cultures projected onto their silence (Berger, 4). “What we know about [animals] is an index of our power,” Berger states, “and thus an index of what separates us from them” (Berger, 14). In this way, the animal becomes both close and unreachable—sharing our environment, yet separated by a barrier of understanding that no performance or attention can break.</p>

      <p>The pigeons are mirrors, not in their exact behaviors but in the way they endure alongside human and city, shaped by our culture nets yet untouched at the core. Berger writes, “In the last two centuries, animals have gradually disappeared. Today we live without them [and in a new solitude]” (Berger, 9). But that’s not how pigeons behave. We have tried to live without them – spikes on ledges, poisons, the sweep of brooms – but we fail. They still settle on statues and pop onto rooftops, minding their own business, too busy to care who Berger is or what ‘new solitude’ those tall two-legged creatures undergo. Their lives run parallel to ours, echoing inherited fear in one place and indifference in another, but always outside the reach of human’s full control. We pretend power over them, but no matter how we build, no matter what we try to exclude, the pigeons are and always will be here and there, co-inhabitants of the city and refusing to vanish.</p>

      <p>In watching pigeons in different spaces and times, I feel that my own power is just as fragile, just as staged, maybe having power over one but never all of them. I walk quickly, I wave my arms, I circle them as though I were the one in charge. But the truth is, they remain while I move on. They claim the same streets I pass through, the same squares I try to call my own. My power lasts only as long as my performance, and even then, it convinces no one—not them, not me.</p>

      <p>The pigeons are not waiting for me to understand them, just as the people of New York are not waiting for me to join their rhythm, just as the people of Beijing once weren’t waiting for the birds to forgive them. We live beside each other, brushing wings and shoulders, leaving crumbs and memories, but parallel as always.</p>

      <p>Berger was right: when I look at animals, I am also looking at myself. In the pigeons’ indifference I see my own attempts to look fierce while hiding unease, my own rehearsed stride across a city that does not pause for me. Their power lies in their refusal to acknowledge my presence, and my power lies only in restraint — choosing not to disturb what I cannot command. Between us, there is this fragile equilibrium, a shared city neither of us owns yet both of us insist on inhabiting. And so, I follow them, step after step, pretending to belong in a kingdom already taken.</p>

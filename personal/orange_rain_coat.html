    <h2>Orange Rain Coat</h2>

    <p class="reveal">I inherited a pumpkin-orange London Fog wind coat from my mother on the morning I accepted my college offer on a rainy day in May. She sat across the table while I clicked “accept,” then stood when I turned my screen toward her, the words “Congrats” and “Welcome” glowing between us. Stay still, she said, in her calm, serious voice—my voice sounds like hers. She walked to our family closet and came back with her orange wind coat in her hands. Bring this with you, she said. Take it to New York City. It’s a good coat, and it will suit you well.</p>
    <p class="reveal">The wind coat traveled to more cities than I did: Nanjing, Beijing, several small towns in China that I’ve never been to, and now with me, it arrives in New York City across half of the globe. And the coat is “older” than me, accompanying mom longer than I do. Mom bought it in early-2000s Beijing, several years before I was born, and long before I started to understand how the lives of ordinary people can be shaped by the timing of history.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Mom grew up in a small and marginalized farm town in Northern China, a place where most people stayed their whole lives before the 1960s because there was nowhere else to go. Her parents’ families had been categorized as “Landowners” during the Cultural Revolution, so they were punished—barred from studying. Farming became the only work they were allowed to do, since factories hired only people categorized as “proletariat” or “martyrs’ families,” those who had sacrificed during the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War.</p>
    <p class="reveal">My grandparents lived with little—little in economy and little in social status—but they saved whatever they could, even small coins from food and tools, to keep my mother in school. This was because, in 1978, Deng Xiaoping announced the Reform and Opening-Up policies that reinstated Gaokao, the national exam that decides who can enter a university. No more chances based on political labels or family categories, but on the score, the intelligence, and the work one put in. For my grandparents, education was the only path they could imagine that might carry their daughter beyond the fields they were forced to stay in. They never let mom stop. Their belief in education was stubborn, was quiet, and was inherited to mom, too.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Gaokao, among many products of the Reform and Opening-Up policy, changed my family’s destiny. It was strict, selective, and the only ladder for millions of people who shared a background like mom’s to leave their assigned social category and access opportunities far beyond what their families could give them. That exam opened the first real door in mom’s life, and once she walked through it, everything that came after—higher education, work, Beijing—became possible.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Her chance to leave was also shaped by timing. Reform and Opening-Up had rebuilt universities, revived Gaokao, and allowed people to move for work. Before that, people needed “introductory letters” from their town government to travel, and my grandparents would never have had the chance to even buy one—the letters were only given to those who were not “Landowners.” As more people grabbed their ladder of education, they moved from towns and countryside to cities. Cities were growing fast, and new jobs appeared as China stepped away from strict collectivism and welcomed factories and investments from across the globe. Foreign goods, private income, and personal choices slowly entered daily life. Mom’s path—from farm fields to a college campus—was possible only because the country was changing at the same time she was growing up.</p>
    <p class="reveal">When my mother worked in Beijing after college, she earned her first real salary at a medicine company supported by the United States in China. The wind coat was the first thing she bought for herself during a moment that felt new to millions of people at the time—wandering through malls to look at clothes, small decorations, and books imported from outside China, various visual stimulus that represented China economy outburst and its lively rejoining into globalization trend—globalization was an extremely positive word for mom from that time to now. The short wind coat was in a bright orange she had never worn before, and it carried the foreign name “London Fog.” Examining her experience from where I stand now, at the end of 2025, I see how this wind coat reached beyond its practical use: it marked the start of a warm, opening era for young people like mom, a kind of optimism that feels distant from what I feel living in today’s world.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Analyzing this coat from my time in 2025, I see how its meaning comes from a larger shift in how people in China began to dress after the late 1970s. Before Reform and Opening-Up, almost everyone wore the same colors—blue, gray, green, and black—and clothing followed the logic of collectivism rather than personal taste. As one study explains, Chinese’s clothes before the reforms was “gray, green, black, and blue,” dominated by military uniforms, Zhongshan suits, and plain cotton workwear that left little room for individuality (Liu et al. 228). Women’s clothing in particular showed little variation because political ideology set the limits of what was considered acceptable. The article notes that “the political-dominated clothing style” of the 1950s–70s created a culture where the “present, single style, and dull tones” reflected a society organized around uniformity rather than personal expression (Liu et al. 228).</p>
    <p class="reveal">This changed dramatically after 1978. When the state reopened universities, welcomed foreign goods, and encouraged economic development, clothing became one of the first visible signs of social change. Liu and her co-authors write that after the reforms, “the political-dominated clothing style evolved into a personal-dominated clothing style,” and women’s images grew “diversified, international, and personalized” (Liu et al. 228). Color returned to daily life. New fabrics like Diqueliang appeared in the late 1970s, and although they were expensive, they signaled a new desire to move beyond survival, toward beauty and choice. Foreign designers also entered China at this time—Pierre Cardin’s 1979 fashion show in Beijing famously “unveiled the ‘redhead’ of Chinese clothing,” marking the moment when global styles began shaping local wardrobes (Liu et al. 229–230). By the mid-1980s, bright dresses, flared pants, and tailored silhouettes replaced the dull, compressed forms of the earlier decades.</p>
    <p class="reveal">These shifts in clothing did not happen on their own. They reflected a society that was opening its borders, loosening political control over daily life, and allowing people to imagine themselves differently. As the article explains, the 1970s–80s became the period when “women’s self-consciousness was aroused,” and clothing transformed from a political symbol into a way to express individuality and aspiration (Liu et al. 230-231). My mom’s London Fog coat belongs to this moment—when color, foreign brands, and personal choice first entered Chinese cities and when young people like her could begin to dress not just to fit in, but to step into a life they had only begun to imagine. A unique sense of freedom brought them a unique sense of joy that only experienced by their generation.</p>
    <p class="reveal">The wind coat also reflects a deeper social shift that was taking place at the same time. Reform and Opening-Up created conditions for massive rural-to-urban migration, and many families like my mom’s experienced mobility for the first time. New jobs appeared in expanding cities, and university graduates were encouraged to take positions in major urban centers. Consumer goods such as foreign-brand coats became small markers of this new status. They signaled that a person had moved beyond subsistence living and could participate in a modern, urban economy.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Modernization theory proposed that economic growth, urbanization, education, and new forms of mobility do not develop separately but rise together, creating conditions in which individuals imagine—and materially pursue—new identities (Wu, 92). China’s Reform and Opening ushered precisely this compressed modernization: cities expanded in scale and function, administrative centers grew into hubs of knowledge and culture, and rural–urban migration surged. In these shifting landscapes, a new middle class began taking shape—one defined less by traditional status markers and more by consumption power, education, and upward mobility. The Chinese middle class emerged at the intersection of “compressed industrialization and rapid urbanization,” distinguished by patterns of aspiration and lifestyle rather than inherited class position (Chen et al, 528). And as their study shows, this class grew not only through policy but through individuals finding “their own pathway to move upward to a higher economic class” even in sectors least supported by institutional structures (Chen et al, 532).</p>
    <p class="reveal">My mom belonged to that first generation of what people now call children of Reform and Opening: young people whose adulthood formed alongside new forms of choice—jobs in foreign-funded companies, imported goods, and the language of global mobility. As Chunling Li describes, this generation experienced a shift toward valuing “individual choices” that contrasted sharply with the collectivist ideals of the planned-economy years (Li, 11). Their clothing became one of the most immediate signs of this shift. In the decades before Reform, women’s images were framed through “simplicity, uniformity, and political symbolism,” with garments emphasizing labor, discipline, and sameness (Liu et al, 2). After Reform, however, imported fashion and commercial culture reoriented how women imagined themselves, allowing “femininity, elegance, and diversity” to re-enter the aesthetic field (Liu et al, 5).</p>
    <p class="reveal">The London Fog coat belonged exactly to this symbolic opening. It brings mom a sense that she could participate in a world that had once been closed off. In modernization terms, it represented what Wu calls the shift from survival values to self-expression values: the moment when material security becomes stable enough that people begin choosing styles, hobbies, and identities according to desire, not necessity. The coat was orange in the way a new era could be—slightly too bright, slightly too bold, slightly too hopeful. And for my mom, placing it into my hands twenty-or-so years later became something like a transmission: not of the optimism of early 2000s China, but of the deeper meaning that objects carry the histories of the people—and the countries—they move through.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Yet the optimism I inherit is fragile. It belonged to a moment when new connections between countries felt natural and full of promise. The present feels different. Borders rise again, slowing the movement of people and information. New technologies appear, but stable work becomes harder to find. For my generation, the excitement that once surrounded China’s opening has already faded, and the language of “unbounded connection” now sounds more like a slogan than a lived reality. The coat passed easily from mom’s hands to mine. The optimism it carries did not.</p>
    <p class="reveal">When I think about my mom slipping this coat on in the early 2000s, I realize she stood at the edge of a very different world. Her youth opened into color, movement, and chances that seemed to multiply each year. Mine opens into something tighter. The air in 2025 feels heavier, as if the world has pulled its borders closer and forgotten how to welcome anything unfamiliar. Economies slow, headlines turn inward, and uncertainty becomes a kind of background noise. Wearing her coat in this moment, I feel the distance between our beginnings. She stepped forward with a confidence that belonged to her era; I step forward with questions she never had to ask. Yet the coat settles on me the same way it settled on her. It holds a warmth that does not depend on the state of the world. I can wear the coat. I am still learning how to wear its optimism. And on some mornings, when the wind cuts through the city and the future feels blurred, the coat feels like a small, persistent reminder that time does not move in a straight line—it circles back, folds, and leaves traces. I carry one of those traces on my shoulders, bright as it was twenty-five years ago, insisting that there is still room to keep walking.</p>

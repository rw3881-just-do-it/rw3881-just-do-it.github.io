      <p>I worked on a self-cleaning door handle system designed to sanitize contact surfaces automatically after use with three other groupmates.
      My role focused on the circuit design and system integration, i.e. developing schematics, selecting components to assembling the working device that includes
      sensors, power control, and sanitizing mechanism. I also led testing to ensure the system activated reliably and performed consistently under real
      use conditions.</p>

      <h2>Cognition-Inspired Autonomy in Puzzle Rearrangement (2023.9)</h2>
      <p>Tangrams are widely applied in training and evaluating human cognitive abilities for exploring the capability of imagination and reasoning with abstract shapes, following the cognitive process with perception, memory, reasoning, and imagination.  We collect a tangrams-based dataset with realworld instances to evaluate the abilities of the generative models. We employ the score-based generative model with incremental enhancement and training strategies. We take great efforts to generate and customize task-specific datasets. The experiment results on the collected datasets demonstrate that our method could effectively rearrange the tangrams at different conditions compared to the baselines. </p>

      <h2>Analysis and Simulation of Rigid Body Pose Measurement Based on 3D Space (2023.3)</h2>
      <p>To address the issue of pose measurement of rigid bodies in three-dimensional space and ensure data reliability, a method based on 3D space is proposed. First, the posture measurement device structure and its initial calibration principles are analyzed. Then, a pose measurement algorithm using the 3-2-1 six-point positioning principle models the rigid body pose and determines its position. Finally, the device's measurement accuracy is verified through physical testing, showing that the method is stable, accurate, and meets industrial production standards.</p>

      <h2>The Model of Solving the Efficiency Problem of Vegetable Garden (2024.9)</h2>
      <p>I observed that the best time for sales is during lunch break, though the short window presents a challenge. To address this, I collected data from four sales to optimize the process of picking, packing, and delivering within the hour, and construct a mathematical model and employing calculus and derivatives. The model can shorten 30% of the whole selling time in real sales. </p>

      <h2>The Model of Finding Slugs in the School Vegetable Garden (2024.9)</h2>
      <p>Randomly picking slugs in the school vegetable garden felt inefficient, so I developed a mathematical model using the Poisson distribution as the fundamental framework to predict where slugs are most likely to be found. The model assumes slugs are stationary—limiting realworld accuracy— helps optimize pest management strategies by focusing on high-probability areas, enforcing the decision-making processes</p>
